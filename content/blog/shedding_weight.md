## Busy or Chaotic?

It's no secret. College students live some of the most fast-paced lives out there. Lecture at 8:00am, internship interview at 10:00, lab at 11:00 with just enough time after to squeeze in a couple minutes for a quick lunch right before two more lectures, dinner, and finally a couple homework assignments to get you in the headspace to fall asleep and repeat it all over again. This rushed lifestyle is certainly not sustainable; running from commitment to commitment all day long will erode at anyone's ability to maintain all these commitments.

Oftentimes, recognizing whether the life you're living is exciting or exhausting, fulfilling or just overfull. The constant stimuli of the buzzing of daily life draws people away from reflection. It discourages frivolous thought, then remolds the meaning of what frivolous is to capture what all this work really should be for.

It's become it's own separate entity. The symptom of your unwillingness to close any door, no matter how empty or wholly disinteresting the room sits behind it is, has now matured.
